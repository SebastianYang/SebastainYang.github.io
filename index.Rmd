I am a cognitive psychologist in [National Chengchi University in Taiwan](http://www.nccu.edu.tw/?locale=en). My major research interest is investigating human cognitive functions, including <font color="#0066FF">categorization</font>, <font color="#0066FF">function learning</font>, <font color="#0066FF">working memory</font>, and <font color="#0066FF">forecasting</font>. In order to understand how cognitive functions work, I do not only conduct behavioral experiments, but also develop computational models (i.e., <font color="#FF0000">neural network models</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Bayesian models</font>) to account for human cognitive functions. I also explore to what extent individuals' performance in complex economic situation (e.g., earned profits in the games of <font color="#0066FF">beauty contest</font> or <font color="#0066FF">double acuation</font>) can be explained by their fundamental cognitive functions (e.g., working memory capacity).

<font color="#FF0000">Data science</font> is another research interest of mine. Specifically, I am developing methods to analze the data collected on the web pages as well as social media with the techniques such as <font color="#0066FF">web scraping</font>, <font color="#0066FF">text mining (or text analysis)</font>, <font color="#0066FF">Chinese word segmentation</font>, <font color="#0066FF">SVM</font>, and other related ones. Due to the success of convolutional neural network (CNN), I also start to explore the possibility of linking <font color="#FF0000">CNN</font> (or other models in deep learning) to the old cognitive models to improve their ecological validity. To these ends, R and Python are the computer languages I use often. My full CV can be downlowaded [here](http://clanlab.dyndns.org/~lxyang/LX-CV-20190105.pdf).
